# Brain activity-derived biomarkers for epileptogensis
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder associated with recurrent spontaneous seizures affected by synchronized neuron activity. A biomarker is a biological indicator of a disease that is used to diagnose or understand it. Biological markers that indicate the development of epilepsy can be beneficial in predicting its onset and tracking its progression. Further knowledge of the disease can also lead to new discoveries, including previously unknown mechanisms of its development, enabling more effective treatments to be developed. In this project, my goal is to combine established biomarkers and develop a program that can predict epilepsy within the first few days following a seizure. I investigated data from rats that were injected with pilocarpine to induce temporal lobe epilepsy and recorded for 12 days following their injection in order to establish this claim. This study's outcomes will be compared to a subsequent recording of the same rats taken three months later to identify which rats exhibit epilepsy.
